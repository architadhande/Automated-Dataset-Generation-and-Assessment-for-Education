# Synthetic Data Generation and Management for Educational Use

This repository documents the progress and outcomes of a directed research project aimed at creating and managing synthetic datasets for academic purposes. 

> **Note:** Due to the confidential nature of the project, no source files or datasets will be shared in this repository.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive system capable of generating realistic and customizable synthetic data for educational use, particularly tailored to individual students' needs. The project involved collaboration across multiple teams, each contributing to different aspects of development and integration.

### Teams and Objectives

- **Team 1**: Focused on timeline management and visualization using visual diagrams.
- **Team 2**: Core development of the dataset generator, customization features, and collaboration with Team 4 on the development of GradeScope autograding for future assignments.
- **Team 3**: Developed methods for manipulating and updating generated data effectively.
- **Team 4**: My team was responsible for:
  - Integration of functionalities such as address and date manipulations using **Faker**.
  - Creation of a **relational database** simulating real-world business environments.
  - Collaborated with Team 2 on developing the autograding system.

## Individual Contributions

As a member of **Team 4**, my contributions included the following:

- **Integration of Functionalities**:
  - Integrated libraries such as **Faker** for realistic address, date, and other field manipulations to enhance the realism of the generated data.
  
- **ERD Design and Database Schema Development**:
  - Designed and developed the **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for a consulting firm database. This ERD was the foundation for a large-scale relational database designed to simulate real-world business processes.
  
- **Data Population**:
  - Used tools like **Mockaroo** to populate the relational database with synthetic data. This data followed the predefined schema and was tailored to reflect potential real-world applications.

## Achievements

One of the most significant accomplishments was the successful collaboration between **Teams 2 and 4** on developing the **GradeScope autograding system**. This system streamlines the evaluation of future coursework, making grading more efficient.

Additionally, the finalized ERD for the **consulting firm database** is set to serve as a primary resource for teaching data management in **ISE 558 - Data Management**. This will act as a foundational educational tool, providing students with practical exposure to database management systems.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained experience with real-world data simulation and synthetic data generation.
- Enhanced knowledge of database schema design and the integration of multiple functionalities for data generation.
- Contributed to the development of an auto-grading system, applying theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems.

## Technologies Used

- **Faker**: Used for generating realistic addresses, dates, and other customizable fields.
- **Mockaroo**: Employed for bulk synthetic data generation and populating the relational database.
- **ERD Design Tools**: Used to develop the consulting firmâ€™s database schema.
- **GradeScope**: Autograding system integration for streamlining coursework evaluation.
